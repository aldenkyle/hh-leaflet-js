Top of their list is a place with plenty of room for themselves and their guests, a large eat-in kitchen, ocean views and a big pool with plenty of outdoor living space. They'd like to stay under their $500,000 budget. The first place their agent Will takes them to see is a 1700 square foot house that's listed for $275,000. It only has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, and no pool, but it's on almost an acre of land so there is room to expand. The home has breath-taking ocean views, but the kitchen is older and the fridge is tiny. The next house they look at is priced higher, at $325,000, but it's also larger, with 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms in 2500 square feet. The best feature of the house is the enormous great room that opens out onto the large deck. Jon loves the pool and outdoor living space but because it's on only ? an acre, Michelle is worried that they wouldn't be able to expand the house in the future. The last house they look at is listed for $450,000 and is made up of 3000 square feet divided among 4 villas. The main villa has a large open kitchen/living/dining space, with a long patio that has a water view. The other three villas are identical, and come with two queen-sized beds, a giant spa tub, and an open shower each. The large pool area comes with a swim-up bar, a separate kiddie pool, a massage table, over-sized patio furniture and a grill. Jon is concerned about the upkeep such a large property would need. After weighing the pros and cons of all 3 properties, Jon and Michelle have reached their decision.;Viti;-18.1239696;179.0122737;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters-international/full-episodes/this-busy-family-of-6-loves-their-tucson-arizona-lifestyle-but-they-yearn-for-a-relaxing-vacation-home-in-fiji target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

She's looking for a place with enough space for her and guests, ocean views, a terrace and a kitchen suitable for cooking up wonderful Italian pasta dishes. She hopes to find a place in a small town or village where she can walk to shops and restaurants. With a budget of about $100,000, she knows it will still be a challenge. The first place her agent, Tony Hackett, shows her is a partially renovated home in Santa Dominica Talao. Listed for $85,000, this place has 2 bedrooms, 1 bath and is 1,183 square feet. While there aren't any ocean views, this home has beautiful views of the mountains. The renovated parts of the house are well done, but a kitchen still needs to be installed and two rooms are in need of a complete remodel. The next house they look at is a home in the town of Scalea. Listed at $102,000, this place has 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and is 700 square feet. Michelle likes the brick floors, wood beamed ceilings and the ocean and mountain views.

The location and layout of the kitchen and second bathroom are oddly placed, there is some water damage, there are some strangely designed stairs and some of the rooms need a bit of a facelift. The last place they look at is back in Santa Dominica Talao, where they check out a 700 square foot, 2 bedroom, 1 bath home for $79,000.

But squeezing their three children and their home-based travel business into a small three-bedroom rental house is growing on their nerves. They're ready to buy a spacious home of their own on this historic Mediterranean island. They're open to remodeling, and their budget is $730,000 US. Real estate agent Frank Riela has learned to navigate the island's somewhat antiquated real estate practices, and believes he can help Jon and Reeva find the perfect home for their family and business. The first house he shows them has three bedrooms and the potential for a second level, sea-view master suite. But Jon doesn't like the home's close proximity to the neighbors. It's listed for 476,000 US. The next place Frank shows them has five bedrooms, but they are spread across three separate buildings, which means that Jon and Reeva's oldest two children, Francesca and Mia, will be sleeping in a separate structure, and Mia's not happy about that. Also, it's listed for a budget-topping $724,000. The final place Frank shows Jon and Reeva is a total fixer. But it has the potential for 3,800 square feet and is priced at only $361,000 US. Just how much renovation are Jon and Reeva willing to take on?

Andrea can trace her family history back to 18th century Italy. Now she and Dan want to introduce their children to her old world roots by buying a vacation home in the Abruzzo region of Italy where both Andrea's mother and grandmother are from. They have a budget of 100,000 Euro (equal to $140,000). They want a charming Italian cottage that has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, some outdoor space, and a working kitchen. The first place Dan and Andrea and their kids go to see with their agent, Nicola Di Girolamo, is at the top of a very windy road in the Abruzzo region. The home has 2 beds and 1 bath in 1300 sq. ft,. and it's listed for the equivalent of $116,000. The exterior of the home is built with stone from the region, but the owners have drilled parts of the wall which has created huge cracks inside the living room. The kitchen is outdated and has very old appliances but at least the bedrooms are a good size and have a nice view. They like that it comes with 1.24 acres of land, but they aren't crazy about the windy road and how much work the home needs. The second place Nikki takes them all to see is in a more accessible area, close to the lake in the town of Penne. It's a 2 bed, 1 bath, 860 square foot cottage listed for the equivalent of $163,000.  They like the charming rounded windows and original fireplace, but the kitchen and bathroom are very outdated. They don't mind the small bedrooms that much, but they would like a better view of the half acre of land the house sits on. The third place Nikki takes them to see is near the town of Citta S'Angelo. It's a one-room 450 square foot cottage with a small kitchen and bathroom, that shares 3 acres of land with an old ruin. They like the idea that they could live in the small finished cottage while building a larger home on the site of the ruin. They also like the views and the amount of land, but Dan is worried it will cost too much as the home is already listed for the equivalent of $135,000.

Her boyfriend Garo is a sound engineer on the same ship. Their favorite cruises are through the Caribbean, and they've gotten to the point where they want a place of their own in the islands so they can spend even more time there. They've chosen St. Maarten, mostly because of its fun atmosphere. Their budget for a getaway condo is $300,000 and the main thing they are looking for is no renovations. That's because back home in Oklahoma, Dia has been renovating her home for several years and it's the last thing she wants to be doing on vacation too. The first place real estate agent Dwain Carbon shows them is listed for $290,000. It's a one bedroom, one bath condo with a fabulous ocean view. But the development is popular with retirees, and Dia and Garo were hoping for a more youthful vibe. The second place is brand new construction, in fact the units are not even completed. This condo, too, has one bedroom and one bath, but no view. However, the condo complex has a fun, inviting, modern vibe. It's listed for $295,000. The third place is listed for $295,000, and is much larger than the other two. It has three bedrooms and two and a half baths, which would give them plenty of room for company. But the location of the complex is not ideal, as it would mean a significant drive into town or to the beach. Which condo will Dia and Garo choose as their island getaway?

For the past 10 years the family has been involved with peace initiatives in the ancient city of Fes, Morocco. They're currently teaching Moroccan women how to make a living by using scraps of fabric to make purses. Since the family is visiting Morocco more and more frequently, Kevin and Kim want to buy a 2nd home there. They want a place with a rooftop terrace, a decent kitchen, 3 or 4 bedrooms and western style bathrooms. They have a budget of $250,000, and Kim is hoping to find something move-in ready while Kevin thinks it would be fun to buy a rundown place he can fix-up himself. Kevin is going alone to search for a home, so Kim can stay behind with the kids who are in the middle of the school year. The first place David Kellar, the Dooley's real estate agent, takes Kevin to see is a 2400 sqaure foot, 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom Dar (house or palace) listed for $210,000. This restored traditonal-style home is covered in Zellige tile and intricate plaster work. Kevin likes the size and layout of the rooms, but there is no working kitchen or bathrooms and the rooftop deck doesn't have the best views. The second place David takes Kevin to see is a complete fixer listed for $40,000. It has room for 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in about 1700 square feet.

There's only one thing missing, wintertime sunshine. For that, they're heading to the U.S. Virgin Islands in search of a vacation home that's sure to deliver. They'd like a two or three bedroom, two bathroom condo that's fully furnished, with a nice patio or deck, and that is within walking distance to a beach. If they could score an actual water view, they'd be delighted. Their budget is $350,000 - $450,000, which actually won't go a very long way in St. Croix, so this could be tough. Sales Associate Kerry Waldo is ready for the challenge. The first place she shows them is listed for $379,000. It has three bedrooms and two large decks, but is far from the beach. The second condo, listed at $460,000, is just steps from the sand, but only has two bedrooms, which means the Katko boys would have to share a room. The third condo also has just two bedrooms, and it's not close to the beach, but it's part of a lush golf course resort, and is listed for the more comfortable price of $350,000. What are Jeff and Tamara willing to compromise on? Walking distance to the beach? A third bedroom? Or price?

With Tyler gone for weeks at a time at sea, Beth has grown weary of their long stretches apart. Not only is she missing time with Tyler, but he is also away from their one-year-old daughter, Alaina. So when an opportunity came to get off the boat and into the office, Beth pushed him to seize the chance. The assignment is a win-win for Beth, because not only does she get to spend more time with her husband, but their whole family gets to do it basking in the sun of picturesque Puerto Rico. The problem however, is Tyler and Beth have never really shared the same space since saying, I do, so they're going to have to learn about their new surroundings while figuring each other out. Fortunately, they have help finding a house at their $1,800 a month budget from real estate agent Raquel Esquenazi. The thing Raquel may not be able to assist with is helping Beth and Tyler adjust to life under the same roof.

He's looking to set up shop and find a condo in the high-end beach district of Punta Cana, known for its white sand beaches and luxury hotels. Scott's main priority is location- he'd love to be able to walk to the beach. He's also looking for a two-bedroom place so he can have a separate office and more storage, and he'd like a pool on the premises. He's hoping his real estate expertise will help him find all of these amenities in a 200 thousand dollar budget. Real estate agent and friend Frances Pimentel is going to help Scott on his search for the right place. The first condo that Frances shows Scott is a one-bedroom, one and a half bath condo right on a golf course. It's listed for 195 thousand dollars and is 1100 square feet. Scott is impressed with the high end details and the luxurious pool area, but he's concerned about the lack of office space and that it's a bit further from the beach than he would like. Next up is a two-bedroom, two-bath condo selling for 180 thousand dollars that's only five minutes from the beach. It's a bit larger than the first at 1200 square feet, and Scott loves the second bedroom and the rooftop terrace, but the fixtures are older and it might need some updating. The third place Scott sees is a two-bedroom, two-bath 1100 square foot condo priced at 150 thousand dollars. He loves the fact that it's brand new, but he's not thrilled with the ongoing construction close by. He's also impressed with the huge private deck, but the unit is a little bit further from the beach and it's a little bit smaller than the other two-bedroom condo. After seeing three terrific options, Scott needs to make his decision. Which condo will become his new Caribbean home?;Punta Cana, Higüey, La Altagracia, República Dominicana;18.556551;-68.3691611;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters-international/full-episodes/dominican-rep-condo-search target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

Now there are five grandchildren in the mix, and beach vacations are what they all enjoy most. Now that Athos and Mary have retired from the restaurant business they're ready to buy a vacation condo so the family can hit the beach together whenever they want. They're focusing their search on the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic because they love the beautiful blue waters, crystal clear skies, and affordable prices. The first condo that real estate agent Rico Pester takes them to has 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths in 1720 square feet. It is in a development that is still under construction. Athos loves the breathtaking beachfront views, and Mary loves the in-unit laundry hook-ups. But the condo is priced at $417,000, which is $17,000 over their budget. The other disadvantage is that the development is a significant drive to town. The next place they see is a little closer in. It's a semi-attached villa that is reminiscent of the Greek architecture of Athos's youth. It has a private courtyard with pool and a spectacular rooftop deck. There are 3 bedrooms and 3 baths. Mary loves the extra space, but is disappointed to hear there is no in-unit laundry hook-up. She also finds the kitchen a bit small, but Athos likes the price: $314,000. The third place Rico takes them to is listed for the even more affordable price of $277,000. It has 2 bedrooms and 2 baths in 1500 square feet. It does not have water views, but it is on a golf course, and is just a short ride to the beach by golf cart. Choosing the right place for their family is not going to be easy, but it's definitely worth it to Athos and Mary who are ready to make this dream a reality for themselves, their children, and their grandchildren.;Punta Cana, Higüey, La Altagracia, República Dominicana;18.556551;-68.3691611;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters-international/full-episodes/multiple-generations-of-the-hatziyannis-family-hope-to-find-a-vacation-home-in-the-dominican-republic target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

Perry's job as an Airline baggage handler means he works outside during even the worst weather. After a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, the couple decided to save up and buy a second home there. They want a 2 bedroom condo on a 2nd floor in a gated community that's close to the beach. But they have a very firm budget of $150,000 which means they may not be able to buy as close to the beach as they'd like. The first place their real estate agent Sabine Gruss takes them to see is a model unit in a large complex with a big pool. The complex is about 5 minutes walking from the beach. The unit has 1 bedroom and 1 and a half bathrooms in 1000 square feet. It's listed at $115,000 but upgrading to a second floor unit means the price would be closer to $120,000. They like the large patio and the updated kitchen but none of the furniture or appliances are included, so that would be an extra expense. They also want two bedrooms in case they have guests. The second place Sabine takes them to see is a condo in a smaller complex. It's about 10 minutes walking from the beach. The condo is on the second floor, and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1100 square feet. It's listed at the top of their price range, at $150,000. They like the small balcony but not the view of the countryside or the small pool in the complex. But Cheryl loves the updated kitchen and bathrooms, and having 2 bedrooms is a big plus. The third place they look at is actually a single family home. It's priced at $148,000 and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1500 square feet. The house itself is older and would need some work in the kitchen and bathrooms. And because it's larger they would have to buy more funriture to fill it up. But it's part of a community with an amazing pool and bar area that both cheryl and perry love. The only other drawback is that it is about a 10 minute drive from the beach. With three interesting options all within their price range, the Meriots' are going to have a tough time deciding which vacation home to buy!;Punta Cana, Higüey, La Altagracia, República Dominicana;18.556551;-68.3691611;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters-international/full-episodes/canadian-couple-buys-a-vacation-home-in-punta-cana-dominican-republic target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

They currently live in Emma's 1 bedroom apartment that's close to Baltimore's Charles Village neighborhood. There isn't enough closet space in the bedroom so Valerio is living out of boxes and the kitchen is too small for Valerio to comfortably cook in. They want to buy a place together so that Valerio won't feel like he is just a guest in Emma's house. The couple wants to buy one of the traditional 3-story row homes common in Baltimore's Canton neighborhood. With their budget of $250,000 to $300,000, they want a row home that comes with parking and an outdoor space. Valerio's used to living in apartments in Italy, so he's excited to purchase a big home with several floors. Emma wants a place that doesn't need a lot of work so that they can enjoy being newlyweds and not fight about home improvement projects. The first row house that agent E.J. Villarreal takes them to see is a 2 bed, 2 bath, 1700 square foot place priced at $280,000. It has brick walls, central air, wood floors and a spacious renovated kitchen. There is a back deck but no parking pad and no roof deck. The master has a huge closet but there isn't alot of closet space in the rest of the house.

He and his wife, Diane, recently retired to Orlando Florida and are now ready to make that dream a reality. They're going to buy a second home in Cuenca. They're bringing their daughter Anna along to help them on this search. With a budget of $120,000, they want to get a 4 bedroom, 2 bath home. They would like a traditional Spanish style home with a view, but still have the modern amenities they have now, such as an open floor plan, built for earthquakes. Their agent, Monica Rodas, takes them to a 4 bed, 1 1/2 bath, house in 2,798 square feet listed for $135,000. It's an older home with a hacienda style layout. While Diane and Juan like the large backyard and how the house reminds Juan of his childhood home, they're concerned that the house is not only above their budget but will need some serious updating. So, Monica takes them to a brand new townhouse listed at $105,000. This place has 4 beds, 3 1/2 baths and is 1,800 square feet. They love all of the modern amenities, such as the open upgraded kitchen, the size of the rooms and the third floor bonus room. But, they wish it had a nice yard like the first house and are concerned about the safety of the staircase to the bonus room. They also wish it had a little more character. Monica then takes them to a house listed for $85,000 in a developing neighborhood. This place has 4 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths and is 2,000 square feet. They like the easy to maintain yard, kitchen pantry and some of the wood details. But, the bedrooms are a bit small and they can hear the construction noise in the neighborhood.

For the Haines, there would be no looking back! The Haines chose one of the most popular destinations for North American expatriates ? Cuenca, the capital city of Ecuador's Anzuay Province. The former Spanish colonial city offers a tropical spring like climate in the foothills of the Ecuadorian Andes. And the cost of living is remarkably low.  Local real estate agent Egidio Tosi specializes in family relocations and he knows Cuenca's market will provide the Haines a choice of properties at a quarter the cost they would face in Canada.

Shortly after getting married Jay went to work on a project in Iraq. Over the past few years the couple hasn't spent much time together because of Jay's travel for work, but now that Jay has returned to the U.S. he and his wife would like to settle down together in Jay's hometown of Detroit. They're staying temporarily at Jay's brothers house while they look for a home, but the current living situation is starting to take its toll because the couple is living out of a suitcase in the small guest bedroom. With their budget of $350,000 to $450,000, they're looking for a 2-3 bedroom home with a large kitchen. Jay leans toward a home in the suburbs while Booyoung prefers something in the city, but both agree that they'd like to live in one of Detroit's historic properties. The first house realtor, Jocelyn ""Joy"" Santiago takes them to see is a warehouse loft conversion originally built in 1906. The 2,070 square foot, 2 bedroom/2 bath condo is listed for $387,500. They love the open feel and the spacious kitchen, but Booyoung is not crazy about the soft walls in the bedrooms that don't go up to the ceiling so they opt to check out another place. The next home is in Detroit's historic Indian Village neighborhood. The 4500 square foot, 5 bedrooms, 3 and half bath home was built in 1915 and is listed for $399,900. They both love the gourmet kitchen, sunroom and spacious backyard. And even though Booyoung likes the huge master closet and the unique tile fireplaces throughout the home, she'd prefer to see something right in the heart of downtown. The third home they go to visit is in a 1924 renovated hotel in downtown Detroit. It is a 2 bedroom, 2 bath, 1400 square foot condo that is listed for $400,000, with a monthly HOA fee of $1000. Jay and Booyoung love the views and the perks of living in a luxury hotel but they are disappointed with the size of the bedrooms and the high HOA fees are a big concern. Jay and Booyoung must weigh the pros and cons of all three homes and choose the one that they'll settle down in for years to come.";Detroit, Michigan;42.3315509;-83.0466403;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/after-constantly-being-on-the-move-for-work-jay-and-his-wife-booyoung-are-ready-to-settle-down-in-a-historic-home-in-detroit target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

They also want to buy a place close to the beach. They have a budget of $700,000, and they've given themselves just 3 days to complete their search. Their real estate agent Bram Shook knows it might be difficult for them to find a place that's both close to the beach that also has ocean views, since in Nosara there is a wildlife refuge that separates all the homes from the beach.

The home has a nice pool and amazing ocean views, though Donna is worried about her grandson's safety since the patio has very little railing.

Later that same day Bram takes them to see a 3400 square foot, 4 bed, 3 bath home that's listed for $650,000.

They are ready to buy a home but don't exactly agree on where. Evan wants to be as close to their restaurant in the city center as he can get, while Maria-Isabel is seeking a quieter, possibly more distant refuge. They both agree on size: 2 bedrooms plus an office, and on style: they like historic homes, and appreciate architectural authenticity. They also like to entertain and would like a hip space to do so. Real Estate Agent Sean Dennis shows them an historic home in the heart of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel love the home's authentic details and view of the cathedral, but Maria-Isabel is concerned about noise. Next Sean shows them a Colonial Reproduction a few minutes outside the center of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel are charmed by the fine finishes, courtyard pool, and rooftop deck, but they are disappointed in the home's lack of authenticity -- since it is a reproduction -- and worry about its ability to retain its value. Also, Maria-Isabel is still hoping for something more tranquil. Finally, Sean shows them a private island home on the lake. He explains that the lake is home to 365 ''isletas'' or private islands, and that this one could be their very own. The island home has a 2 bedroom home, and a 2 bedroom guest house, and beautiful natural landscaping. Evan and Maria-Isabel are wowed by the property, but concerned about the price, and the difficult commute (by boat). They weigh the pros and cons of each property, and ultimately choose the first house they saw - the authentic colonial in the heart of town. Their restaurant is just 2 blocks away, they love the proximity to friends and to all that the city has to offer, and Maria-Isabel finds that when the centuries old doors are shut, she cannot hear the noisy street outside. They love their new haven in the city.;Granada, Nicaragua;11.8134002;-85.9031625;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters-international/full-episodes/evan-and-maria-isabel-set-out-to-a-find-home-in-historic-granada-nicaragua-that-is-both-relaxing-and-convenient-to-the-restaurant-they-own target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

They've fallen in love with Roatan, a small island off the coast of Honduras, so they've decided to purchase a home so they can spend several months there at a time rather than a week or two. Their daughter Kelsey and her fiance Dan are avid divers, so they're thrilled about the decision. Les and Anita are looking for a move-in ready 3 bedroom home that's large enough for the entire family and they really want a place that's close to the beach, has an ocean view and has room for a garden. Their budget is 300 thousand US dollars and they've enlisted Robert Sirois, a local realtor to assist them in their search. They've also created their own checklist to help rate each property and help them with their decision. The first place they see is a two bedroom, two bathroom 1800 square foot house in the Sunset Villa development listed for 289 thousand dollars. They really like the updated furnishings and the fact that it's only five minutes from the beach, but there is no ocean view. The next day Robert takes them to see a three bedroom, three bath 2100 square foot tri-level house in West End selling for 299 thousand dollars. They like the space and the nice views from each balcony, but the area in front of the house is being developed so there is no guarantee that they will keep their sea views. It also doesn't have a pool. The last place they see is an 1100 square foot 3 bedroom home in Turtle Crossing listed for 295 thousand dollars. It's close to the water, and has great views, but it's a bit small compared to the other properties and it needs some updating.

She's very low-key, and lets him handle all the family worries. But despite their differences in personality, they agree that the family deserves the vacation home they've been saving ten years to afford. They'd like to buy a place now for vacations, and ultimately retire there. Their house in the planned community of Columbia, Maryland is large and comfortable, but it's far from the soothing sounds of the ocean that Loretta loves so much. They're focusing their search on the small island of Roatan, off the coast of Honduras, because of its peaceful beaches, and unspoiled feel. They'd like three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and while Loretta would like to wake up to the surf in her back yard and sand in her toes, Jim thinks an ocean view property would be a better investment. Their budget is $800,000. The first place Realtor Mike Carter shows them has three bedrooms and two baths in 2,000 square feet. It's a new, oceanfront development with luxury finishes, and the condo is listed at $699,000. They love the oceanfront location, but feel like the condo lacks privacy from the neighbors. The second place they see is a single family home. It has ocean views, luxury finishes, and is listed for $775,000. It is much larger than the first, with four bedrooms, fouir baths, and 3,000 square feet. Jim and Loretta love the privacy and think the home is beautiful, but they're concerned about the long walk from the parking lot, especially since they plan to ultimately retire here. The third home is a 3,315 square foot, oceanfront condo with convenient parking. It has two bedrooms, three baths, and is listed for $769,000.

They want to buy their first place and get a little separation from the family business. They are looking for condos in their same popular Chicago neighborhood, Lakeview. They want a place that has room for a home office, a spacious kitchen and a parking spot. Their budget is $325,000 to $400,000. The only thing they don't agree on is style. Kelly wants a vintage condo with lots of charm, and Kurt prefers the open Loft-style look. The first place their real estate agent Eric Rojas takes them to see is a 1200 square foot, 2 bedroom, 2 bath loft style condo that's listed for $415,000. Kurt likes the brick walls and exposed ducts, but Kelly's not crazy about the open kitchen and small living room. She's also not crazy about the balcony being off the 2nd bedroom. The second place they see is listed for $355,000. It's a 2 bed, 1 bath, 1300 square foot vintage style condo. Kelly is thrilled with the vintage charm, the large dining room, separate kitchen and re-done bathroom. Kurt is happy there is a space for his home office but he's not in love with the traditional look. The third home is a 2-story loft style townhouse. It's priced at $400,000 and has 2 bedrooms and 2 baths in 1100 square feet. Kurt likes the high ceilings and that you get alot for your money, but Kelly's not crazy about the small open kitchen and the outdated bathrooms.

They want to be close to the water, have the place already nicely furnished and have enough room to relax. Ideally they're looking for a two bedroom place and don't want to spend more than 300,000 US dollars. Real estate agent Steve Reid joins them on their search and first shows them a two bedroom, two bath condo in Bermuda Beach. It's listed for 275 thousand dollars and it's 1000 square feet. It's brand new, has an ocean view, and even a spa tub in the master bedroom, but it has a pretty small kitchen, balcony and eating area. The outside pool and BBQ area are great, but there's also some ongoing construction. The guys check in with the girls via computer at the end of their day and the girls aren't thrilled with the size of the place. The next place that Steve takes them to see is a two bedroom, two bath condo at Brightwaters Beach Resort listed for 279 thousand dollars. It's a bit larger at 1100 square feet and there are great ocean views, but the decor is outdated and it's far from town. This time the girls aren't so sure about such a remote place. So the next day the guys are back on the hunt. Steve takes them to Las Terrazas to see a condo listed for 279 thousand dollars that's a bit under 1000 square feet. The guys are impressed with the grounds and the spa-like atmosphere, but they aren't thrilled when Steve tells them that the condo only has one bedroom. But it's beautifully decorated, updated and steps from the beach. When Craig and Rydell call the girls via computer that evening, they just aren't so sure about the one bedroom.

Commander in the U.S. Coast Guard and lives in Ormond Beach, Florida with his wife, Jenni, and their kids Ariana, Mateo and David. The Coast Guard just reassigned Roberto from Ormond Beach to Mobile, Alabama. Since this tour of duty will be over four years, Roberto and Jenni decided to buy a house in Mobile. The only catch? The Coast Guard gave them about a month to research Mobile. Now, Roberto and Jenni only have five days to actually go to Mobile and buy a house. Adding to that pressure, they have a pretty long list of things they need in the house. With such a tight time frame, their agent Kyla Gaston has her work cut out for her. The first home they check out is listed for $185,000. It's a model home, which is on the market. This place has 4 beds, 2 baths and is 1,930 square feet. Jenni loves the upgraded open kitchen. The backyard is big and unfenced. Their biggest concern is that there is a lot of construction in the neighborhood. The next house they look at is brand new and is listed for $222,000. This place has 4 bedrooms, 2 baths and is 2,320 square feet. Jenni likes the easy to care for floors and master suite. They both like the fenced in backyard. But, they are both concerned that there isn't enough storage space and that the living room may not be big enough for their piano. While the kitchen is updated, it's a bit small and isn't open to the family room. The last place they see is a custom built home. Jenni and Roberto like the custom details, such as the hardwood and tile floors, the addition and jetted tub in the master suite. The backyard at this home is also fenced in, which is a plus. They don't like some of the more funky details, like an incense holder and the built in TV cabinet. The kitchen is a bit dark and the price is on the high end of their budget. After weighing the pros and cons of each home, Jenni and Roberto make their decision within their 4 day window.;Mobile, Alabama;30.6943566;-88.0430541;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/coast-guard-family-relocates-from-florida-to-mobile-alabama-but-only-has-five-days-to-find-and-buy-a-home target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

She left behind her family and friends in West Virginia and moved to Gulfport Mississippi. With a budget of $200,000 to $300,000, she's looking for a 3 bed, 2 bath, southern style home with great architectural details. Since she's downsizing from her 5,100 square foot home in West Virginia, she wants to have lots of storage space and is determined to get a ""hers & hers"" closet in the master bedroom. As a master gardener, Alisa wants a big backyard that she can landscape. But, more importantly she wants that outdoor space for her babies, Callie & Archie, her bearded collies, which are being taken care of by friends in West Virginia. Gulfport broker, Bridget Ferrucci is determined to help Alisa find the perfect house for her fresh start. The first place Bridget takes Alisa to is in the Diamondhead community near Gulfport. This 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath home has 2,257 square feet and is listed at $270,000. Alisa likes the open layout, high ceilings, upgraded kitchen and bathrooms. She especially loves the southern style patio and backyard. But, the master bedroom doesn't have a ""hers & hers"" closet and the front of the house lacks southern charm. The second place is in the heart of Gulfport. Listed for $258,000, this house has 3 beds, 2 1/2 baths and is 2,265 square feet. Alisa loves the southern style exterior, the architectural details, upgraded kitchen and bathrooms and the ""hers & hers"" closet. On the downside, she thinks the backyard isn't big enough and feels that the patio isn't nearly as wonderful as that of the first house. Option number three is in the D'Iberville community near Gulfport. Listed for $280,000, this home has 3 bedrooms, 3 baths and 3,000 square feet. Alisa loves the high ceilings, the large kitchen, open floor plan, beautiful porch and big backyard. She thinks it's elegant but comfortable. But, she would love to have granite countertops in the kitchen and is concerned about the light colored carpet, because of her dogs.

Four kids, two dogs and three foreign countries later, they've landed in Las Vegas, Nevada. For the first time in their lives they can buy a house and they want something with at least 4 bedrooms, an open kitchen, and a big backyard. Their 11 year old, Jacob, wants a bedroom on the 2nd floor, and their 9 year old Lauren, doesn't like having the household's linen closet in her bedroom. Craig and Angie have a strict budget of $250,000. In case Craig gets transferred, they want to be able to rent the home out without taking a loss. They have turned to realtor Rob Jensen for help in finding a large house in North Las Vegas on their strict budget. The firs place Rob shows them is a 4 bed, 2.5 bath, 2670 square foot house that's listed for $204,900. They like the large open floorplan and kitchen, but the backyard is tiny and leaves alot to be desired. Upstairs, the bedrooms are all a good size, but there are only 4 of them and Craig and Angie were hoping for a place with 5 bedrooms. The next day, Rob takes them to see a 5 bedroom, 3 bath house that's larger, with 2,838 sq. ft. It's listed for $199,000 but because it's a foreclosure, there is alot of work that needs to be done. Overall, Craig is unimpressed with the condition of the house. Even though it's affordable, they would have to do a lot of work to it, especially the carpeting. But it does have an enormous backyard which they both like and the 5 bedrooms which is a big plus. The last place Rob takes them to see is a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house with a separate office that could be converted into a 5th bedroom. It's the largest with 3740 square feet, but its also the most expensive, at $259,000. The home is in move-in ready condition, though Angie isn't a fan of the rock walls in the main living area. The backyard is fantastic, with a built-in grill, TV, seating area and playground. All of the bedrooms and the office would work as well. They really like the house but it is over their budget and they aren't sure they would be able to make it work. After seeing three good options, Craig and Angie have to make their decision.;Las Vegas, Nevada;36.1672559;-115.1485163;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/large-family-stationed-in-vegas-buys-first-home target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

Unfortunately, she brough so much stuff with her that her parents have had a hard time storing it all. She's taken over half the garage, part of their closet, and has even stored her extra mattresses in their bedroom. After 6 months, her parent's had had enough so they gave Regina the money for a down payment on a condo so she could successfully move out on her own. She's set her budget at $350K to $400K. Regina wants a place close to the shops and restaurants in downtown San Jose, California. She'd also like 2 bedrooms, a community pool and gym and to have a private patio. The first place her agent Jenn Holst takes her to is an 851 square foot, 1 bed, 1 bath unit in a high-rise building in the heart of San Jose. It's close to her job and the shops and restaurants downtown, but at $410,000, it's a little over her budget. She likes the views and the small balcony, but it doesn't have two bedrooms or a pool and the unit itself is small. The second place she goes to see is further from downtown. It's 1350 square foot, 1 bed, 1.5 bath loft listed for $399,000. Regina likes the high ceilings and modern style, and even though it has only one bedroom there's an additional loft area she could use as an office. But the community has no gym or pool and it's farther from downtown than she'd like to be. The last place Regina looks at is even further out from the city. It's a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 1170 square foot condo listed for $395,000. Not only does it have the second bedroom she wants, the community also comes with both a gym and pool. Regina's also thrilled that all of the appliances are included. In fact, the only drawback is that it's the furthest from downtown and her job. Regina's got a tough decision to make. If she goes for the first place she'll be in the heart of downtown but she'll be choosing the smallest unit with the highest price tag. If she goes for the second place she'll get more space and a community gym, but a longer drive to the city and work. And if she goes for the last place she gets everything on her wishlist except for the location. So which one will it be?;Regina, California;33.4865332;-117.7072725;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/single-gal-regina-clark-leaves-home-to-buy-a-condo-in-san-jose-california target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

They love the Los Angeles suburb of La Canada for its top schools, hilly views, and abundance of big leafy trees. They also love its easy access to downtown Los Angeles, due to the freeways that run through town. What they don't love is the freeway noise. Their busy schedules have made house hunting a challenge, so they're growing desperate to find a home that meets all their criteria: four bedrooms, four baths, formal dining room, family room, in a quieter section of town, for under two million dollars. The first home that Real Estate Agent Christiana Matarese shows Karmen and Jeff is a traditional California ranch that is set back from the street so it's very quiet. It has four bedrooms and four baths in about 4,000 square feet. The asking price is 1.8 million. The first thing they notice is that the home's current owner began renovations on the home, and then walked away leaving the house in a state of disrepair. Outside they see the pool, the pool house, and the large grassy yard. Karmen and Jeff love the property's sylvan setting. The only thing they don't like about the house is the unfinished kitchen, because it would mean expensive and possibly lengthy renovations. The next house Christiana takes them to see is completely renovated. It's at the end of a long private driveway, so it's very quiet. At 1.5 million dollars, it is a little less expensive, but it is significantly smaller with 2,660 square feet, four bedrooms and three baths. Jeff & Karmen love the renovations and the abundance of natural light, but it's the backyard that really blows them away. In addition to the pool, rolling green lawn, the backyards also has a sports court. Unfortunately, a power line tower is also in the backyard, which concerns Jeff & Karmen. The third house Christiana shows them is in a prime section of town, surrounded by beautiful older homes and close to shopping. It's the most expensive, at 2.149 million dollars. It has 4 bedrooms and 3 baths in 3,300 square feet. Jeff & Karmen like the traditional layout but are put-off by the dated decor, and specifically, the abundance of patterned wallpaper. The couple's main concern with the house is that it is beyond their budget, and making it move-in ready would require even move money. Just how much remodeling are Jeff & Karmen willing to squeeze into their busy lives? Will they choose the first home, which requires significant renovations? The second, which was move-in ready? Or will they choose the third, which needed many cosmetic updates?;Los Angeles, California;34.0536909;-118.2427666;<a href=https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/young-doctors-jeff-karmen-look-at-large-family-homes-in-suburban-los-angeles target="_blank">Watch on HGTV GO</a>

Currently, they live in a rented condo with no yard space and lots of stairs. In their new home, they'd like few stairs, and a nice back yard where Kaelie can play. They also want 4-5 bedrooms Nancy and Mike love the way the home has been renovated, but are upset to see that a large pool takes up the entire back yard. Nancy definitely does not want a pool. Mike is also concerned that at $940,000, the home is beyond their budget. The next house they see is a tri-level contemporary with 3 bedroom and 3 1/2 baths. It's listed at $850,000. Mike and Nancy like the updated finishes and open, sunny spaces. The kitchen is renovated, but the appliances are not stainless steel, like Nancy prefers. The home has two yard areas -- one is grassy and the other has a deck and hot tub. And there is no pool which makes Nancy very happy. On the other hand, the home's multi-level design is a negative to the couple, who were looking to avoid stairs. The third home that Colm takes Mike and Nancy to see is two-story traditional with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, and is listed at $875,000. The home's decor is not to the couple's taste, but they love the updated kitchen which opens to the family room.

They also want 4-5 bedrooms Nancy and Mike love the way the home has been renovated, but are upset to see that a large pool takes up the entire back yard. Nancy definitely does not want a pool.

Mike and Nancy like the updated finishes and open, sunny spaces. The kitchen is renovated, but the appliances are not stainless steel, like Nancy prefers. The home has two yard areas -- one is grassy and the other has a deck and hot tub. And there is no pool which makes Nancy very happy.

Four kids, two dogs and three foreign countries later, they've landed in Las Vegas, Nevada. For the first time in their lives they can buy a house and they want something with at least 4 bedrooms, an open kitchen, and a big backyard. Their 11 year old, Jacob, wants a bedroom on the 2nd floor, and their 9 year old Lauren, doesn't like having the household's linen closet in her bedroom. Craig and Angie have a strict budget of $250,000. In case Craig gets transferred, they want to be able to rent the home out without taking a loss. They have turned to realtor Rob Jensen for help in finding a large house in North Las Vegas on their strict budget. The firs place Rob shows them is a 4 bed, 2.5 bath, 2670 square foot house that's listed for $204,900. They like the large open floorplan and kitchen, but the backyard is tiny and leaves alot to be desired. Upstairs, the bedrooms are all a good size, but there are only 4 of them and Craig and Angie were hoping for a place with 5 bedrooms. The next day, Rob takes them to see a 5 bedroom, 3 bath house that's larger, with 2,838 sq. ft. It's listed for $199,000 but because it's a foreclosure, there is alot of work that needs to be done. Overall, Craig is unimpressed with the condition of the house. Even though it's affordable, they would have to do a lot of work to it, especially the carpeting. But it does have an enormous backyard which they both like and the 5 bedrooms which is a big plus. The last place Rob takes them to see is a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house with a separate office that could be converted into a 5th bedroom. It's the largest with 3740 square feet, but its also the most expensive, at $259,000. The home is in move-in ready condition, though Angie isn't a fan of the rock walls in the main living area. The backyard is fantastic, with a built-in grill, TV, seating area and playground. All of the bedrooms and the office would work as well. They really like the house but it is over their budget and they aren't sure they would be able to make it work.

They love the Los Angeles suburb of La Canada for its top schools, hilly views, and abundance of big leafy trees. They also love its easy access to downtown Los Angeles, due to the freeways that run through town. What they don't love is the freeway noise. Their busy schedules have made house hunting a challenge, so they're growing desperate to find a home that meets all their criteria: four bedrooms, four baths, formal dining room, family room, in a quieter section of town, for under two million dollars. The first home that Real Estate Agent Christiana Matarese shows Karmen and Jeff is a traditional California ranch that is set back from the street so it's very quiet. It has four bedrooms and four baths in about 4,000 square feet. The asking price is 1.8 million. The first thing they notice is that the home's current owner began renovations on the home, and then walked away leaving the house in a state of disrepair. Outside they see the pool, the pool house, and the large grassy yard. Karmen and Jeff love the property's sylvan setting. The only thing they don't like about the house is the unfinished kitchen, because it would mean expensive and possibly lengthy renovations. The next house Christiana takes them to see is completely renovated. It's at the end of a long private driveway, so it's very quiet. At 1.5 million dollars, it is a little less expensive, but it is significantly smaller with 2,660 square feet, four bedrooms and three baths. Jeff & Karmen love the renovations and the abundance of natural light, but it's the backyard that really blows them away. In addition to the pool, rolling green lawn, the backyards also has a sports court. Unfortunately, a power line tower is also in the backyard, which concerns Jeff & Karmen. The third house Christiana shows them is in a prime section of town, surrounded by beautiful older homes and close to shopping. It's the most expensive, at 2.149 million dollars. It has 4 bedrooms and 3 baths in 3,300 square feet. Jeff & Karmen like the traditional layout but are put-off by the dated decor, and specifically, the abundance of patterned wallpaper. The couple's main concern with the house is that it is beyond their budget, and making it move-in ready would require even move money. Just how much remodeling are Jeff & Karmen willing to squeeze into their busy lives? Will they choose the first home, which requires significant renovations? The second, which was move-in ready? Or will they choose the third, which needed many cosmetic updates?",39,Los Angeles,California,1,House Hunters,"Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, United States of America","(34.0536909, -118.2427666, 0.0)",34.0536909,-118.2427666,0,https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/peaceful-suburban-la-homes,Bad,

She likes the views and the small balcony, but it doesn't have two bedrooms or a pool and the unit itself is small. The second place she goes to see is further from downtown. It's 1350 square foot, 1 bed, 1.5 bath loft listed for $399,000. Regina likes the high ceilings and modern style, and even though it has only one bedroom there's an additional loft area she could use as an office. But the community has no gym or pool and it's farther from downtown than she'd like to be. The last place Regina looks at is even further out from the city. It's a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 1170 square foot condo listed for $395,000. Not only does it have the second bedroom she wants, the community also comes with both a gym and pool. Regina's also thrilled that all of the appliances are included. In fact, the only drawback is that it's the furthest from downtown and her job. Regina's got a tough decision to make. If she goes for the first place she'll be in the heart of downtown but she'll be choosing the smallest unit with the highest price tag. If she goes for the second place she'll get more space and a community gym, but a longer drive to the city and work. And if she goes for the last place she gets everything on her wishlist except for the location. So which one will it be?",39,Regina,California,0,House Hunters,"Regina, California","Regina, Monarch Beach, Dana Point, Orange County, California, 92629, United States of America","(33.4865332, -117.7072725, 0.0)",33.4865332,-117.7072725,0,https://watch.hgtv.com/tv-shows/house-hunters/full-episodes/single-gal-regina-clark-leaves-home-to-buy-a-condo-in-san-jose-california,Bad,

Commander in the U.S. Coast Guard and lives in Ormond Beach, Florida with his wife, Jenni, and their kids Ariana, Mateo and David. The Coast Guard just reassigned Roberto from Ormond Beach to Mobile, Alabama. Since this tour of duty will be over four years, Roberto and Jenni decided to buy a house in Mobile. The only catch? The Coast Guard gave them about a month to research Mobile. Now, Roberto and Jenni only have five days to actually go to Mobile and buy a house. Adding to that pressure, they have a pretty long list of things they need in the house. With such a tight time frame, their agent Kyla Gaston has her work cut out for her. The first home they check out is listed for $185,000. It's a model home, which is on the market. This place has 4 beds, 2 baths and is 1,930 square feet. Jenni loves the upgraded open kitchen. The backyard is big and unfenced. Their biggest concern is that there is a lot of construction in the neighborhood. The next house they look at is brand new and is listed for $222,000. This place has 4 bedrooms, 2 baths and is 2,320 square feet. Jenni likes the easy to care for floors and master suite. They both like the fenced in backyard. But, they are both concerned that there isn't enough storage space and that the living room may not be big enough for their piano. While the kitchen is updated, it's a bit small and isn't open to the family room. The last place they see is a custom built home. Jenni and Roberto like the custom details, such as the hardwood and tile floors, the addition and jetted tub in the master suite. The backyard at this home is also fenced in, which is a plus. They don't like some of the more funky details, like an incense holder and the built in TV cabinet. The kitchen is a bit dark and the price is on the high end of their budget.
